                     QML port of Roy Hopkins' ClassicPrint
                     =====================================

This is the port of "ClassicPrint" for the N900 to QML. It re-uses most of the
C++/Qt backend, but adds a QML interface (image provider + other object) to
utilize the ClassicPrint core from a QML application on e.g. MeeGo Harmattan.
